# boxGame_using_pygame
A beginner-friendly 2D box game developed using Python and Pygame. This project helped me learn game loops, keyboard controls, and basic animation.


# 2D Box Game — Built with Python & Pygame 
This is a simple 2D game that I created using Python and Pygame. In this game, a box moves around the screen when the player uses the keyboard keys. I built this project to learn the basics of game development, such as the game loop, movement, events, and collision handling.

The main goal of the project was not just to make a game, but to understand how games work behind the scenes — how objects move, how the screen updates, and how user input controls the game.

# What the Game Does---

You control a box on the screen
You can move the box using the keyboard keys
The box stays inside the game window and does not move outside
The game keeps updating while you play using a game loop
The project focuses on logic and learning, not on graphics
